# Budget App

This TypeScript app runs on SolidJS, using:
- Tailwind for styling,
- d3 for graphs,
- TanStack to handle API queries, and 
- Firebase for backend.

## Running the project locally
After cloning, you will need to create a .env file to store the Firebase API key.
You can then run `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`). Once that's done, you can start the development server: 

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
